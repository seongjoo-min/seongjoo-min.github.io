		<p><b>Selected Student Feedback (I really appreciate everyone who has taken my course!)</b></p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li><font size="+1">"Professor Min is amazing! One of the best professors I have ever had at Iowa. Funny, well-spoken, and always highly focused on how he is conveying content."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"Thanks for alway being available during office hours. Your jokes also made lecture much more enjoyable to be in."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"You are a very great teacher and were always super helpful in office hours. It is clear that you love what you teach, which is exciting for a student."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"This course was a great build-off of Stats for Business with lots of focus on how it would be applicable in the real world, so I really enjoyed the course. I could see myself using the things I learned in this course in the future at a firm, and I think the knowledge I gained from it will be valuable to me going forward."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"The homework were well done and easy to follow. In previous courses in the department, using the statistical softwares on homework assignments was confusing and required me to put extra hours into correctly easy to explain mistakes. However, in this course, the homework was abundantly clear and super easy to follow along with. I learned more about the course from doing the homework and developed a better understanding of how I would use the course material in the real world."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"When I had heard about econometrics from friends, I heard horror stories... but they did not have Dr. Min. This course has been so well taught and I really feel that I understand everything we learned this year. Dr. Min is what made this class so great for me."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"Covering such a body of material in the limited time of the semester was extremely impressive. Explanations were extremely succinct, and it is evident that you are have an excellent understanding of theoretical econometrics."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"Professor Min is probably the most willing and excited professor I have ever had to help students. Almost always he is able to answer student questions and is always willing to give guidance-- truly a professor who wants his students to succeed and do well in his class (which he knows can be challenging)."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"I enjoyed the class, and Professor Min is an amazing Teacher who teaches so students can understand the material using simple words, unlike most teachers who make it harder to understand. He is always available during his office hours and willing to explain the material further."</font></li>
				<li><font size="+1">"I personally felt well-supported and respected."</font></li>
