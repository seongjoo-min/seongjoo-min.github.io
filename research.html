		<p1><b>Abstract:</b> 
		U.S. consumers view rewards as the most attractive credit card feature, and the expenditures of credit card companies on customer rewards have been rising sharply. In 2018, American Express Company alone spent $9.7 bil., which accounted for a third of its total expenses. In addition, $8.4 bil. in unclaimed rewards remained at the end of the year. Travel rewards are an important component of credit card rewards, and major credit card companies in the U.S. operate loyalty programs, in which customers may transfer points to the loyalty programs of airlines and hotel chains. A credit card company’s portfolio of transfer partners involves strategic partnerships with other companies and is a significant source of product differentiation. This paper studies how credit card companies choose their portfolios of airline transfer partners and the implications for credit card users. In particular, the focus is on how resource complementarity and the network of firms affect whether to maintain, add, or delete a transfer partner. The choice of portfolios is modeled as a sequential network formation process, where transfer partnerships are determined via a sequence of bilateral meetings. Using a network formation model is necessary because whether or not to form a transfer partnership with an airline depends on the current state of the credit card company’s portfolio, the portfolios of other credit card companies, and the partnership structure among other companies. This paper conducts a revealed-preference analysis using data collected from 2014 to 2018. Estimation results indicate that a credit card company is more likely to form a transfer partnership with an airline that improves the points redemption capabilities of its loyalty program, suggesting that the complementarity of resources possessed by airlines positively affects partner choice. The pursuit of resource complementarity aligns with the welfare of credit card users. Estimation results also indicate that the network of firms has a significant effect on partner choice.

		<p style="text-align:center;">Search Cost and Information on Price Discounts: Your Consumer Surplus May Vary</p>
		<p1><b>Abstract:</b>
		Online social shopping platforms enable ordinary shoppers to share information on price discounts (i.e., sales at a retailer), product quality, and their opinions on whether it is a "good deal". Such practices not only reduce search costs for the users but also allow them to make purchases at lower prices. Moreover, the shopping platforms form partnerships with manufacturers and retailers (the sellers) to allow price discounts exclusive for their users. This paper studies how an online social shopping platform creates discrepancies in prices faced by online shoppers and their implications on consumer welfare. The focus is on price discrepancies in identical electronics products sold by reputable online retailers. For a large number of electronics products, spot prices on Amazon.com (serve as "standard" online prices), spot prices from postings on the shopping platform ("discount" online prices), and Clickstream data (for purchase verification on the shopping platform) are utilized to study two market outcomes. First, the paper checks how the price discrepancies, in percentage terms, depend on product characteristics, such as list prices. Second, it quantifies the discrepancy in consumer welfare induced by the shopping platform.
