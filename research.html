			</p>
			<p1><b>Abstract:</b>
			By forming partnerships with hotel chains and airlines, major credit card issuers in the U.S. allow customers to transfer points from their loyalty programs to the partners'. Hotel chains form similar partnerships with airlines, and airlines with other airlines. Viewing their partnerships as a network and using a sequential network formation model, this article studies how credit card issuers and hotel chains strategically choose to add, delete, or maintain partnerships with airlines. Using a novel dataset that involves 3 credit card issuers, 7 hotel chains, and 43 airlines from 2014 to 2018, the estimation result suggests that a credit card issuer is more likely to form a partnership with an airline that (1) is a partner of another credit card issuer (2) is a partner of its hotel chain partner (3) better complements its existing portfolio of airline partners, after accounting for key characteristics of firms. The first two results are similar when hotel chains choose airline partners.

			<p1><b>Abstract:</b>
			Viewing the Input-Output matrix as a network of industries, this paper studies how the interconnectedness of domestic U.S. industries is affected by exogenous shocks, such as changes in tax rates and import duty rates. It also proposes a method for making predictions on the Input-Output matrix under hypothetical scenarios. A key innovation is utilizing a stochastic blockmodel to categorize industries into blocks that share block-specific fixed effects and then using a dyadic regression model. This paper presents empirical results using the 2007 Input-Output matrix of the U.S. economy.

			<p1><b>Abstract:</b>
			Analysis of the U.S. tech sector's supplier-buyer network shows an expansion of ecosystems around major firms from 2003 to 2014. Community detection methods reveal four distinct ecosystems, each led by AAPL, DELL, IBM, and MSFT. Substantial expansion of communities associated with AAPL and MSFT underscores their rising importance, or centrality, within the U.S. tech sector. This paper provides a model-based explanation for such rising importance and its potential impact under counterfactual scenarios.

			<p1><b>Abstract:</b>
			Online social shopping platforms empower users to share “deals”. Users share information on price discount, product quality, and their opinion on overall value. It is evident that overall value of a “deal” depends on product characteristics such as product type (e.g., durable v.s. nondurable) and non-product characteristics such as price history (e.g., frequently on sale v.s. rarely on sale). This paper models consumer’s response to “deals” as a function of product and non-product characteristics and empirically quantifies it.

			<p1><b>Abstract:</b>
			We consider linear-in-means peer effects model with a social network in which individuals may systematically misreport friendships (“measurement error”) due to unobserved heterogeneities. Both the outcome variable of the linear-in-means model and the measurement error could covary with unobserved heterogeneities, so that peer effects are not identified. Moreover, instruments that depend on the social network may be invalid in the presence of measurement error. We propose conditions for identifying peer effects in the presence of measurement error and a consistent estimator.
