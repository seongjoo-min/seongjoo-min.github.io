		<p1><b>Abstract:</b> 
		Abstract Travel rewards are an important component of credit card rewards, and major credit card issuers in the U.S. operate loyalty programs, in which customers may transfer points to the loyalty programs of partner airlines and hotel chains. A credit card issuer’s portfolio of transfer partners involves strategic partnerships with other firms and is a significant source of product differentiation. In a network environment, this paper studies how credit card issuers choose their portfolios of airline transfer partners. In particular, the focus is on how the complementarity of resources possessed by an airline and the network of firms affect whether to add, delete, or maintain a transfer partnership with the airline. I model the choice of portfolios as a sequential network formation process, where transfer partnerships between credit card issuers and airlines are determined via a sequence of bilateral meetings. Using a network formation model is necessary because whether or not to form a transfer partnership with an airline may depend on the current state of the credit card issuers’s portfolio of transfer partners, the portfolios of other credit card issuers, and partnerships between hotel chains and airlines. This paper conducts a revealed-preference analysis using observations from 2014 to 2018. Estimation results indicate that a credit card issuer is more likely to form a transfer partnership with an airline that better complements its other airline partners. Moreover, the network of firms has a significant effect on partner choice.

		<p1><b>Abstract:</b>
		Online social shopping platforms enable ordinary shoppers to share information on price discounts, product quality, and their opinions on whether it is a "good deal". Such practices not only reduce search costs for the users but also allow them to make purchases at lower prices. Moreover, the shopping platforms form partnerships with manufacturers and retailers to allow price discounts exclusive for their users. This paper studies how an online social shopping platform creates discrepancies in prices faced by online shoppers and their implications on consumer welfare. I focus on price discrepancies in identical electronics products sold by reputable online retailers. For a large number of electronics products, I utilize spot prices on Amazon.com (serve as "standard" online prices), spot prices from postings on the shopping platform ("discount" online prices), and Clickstream data (for purchase verification on the shopping platform) to study two market outcomes. First, I check how the price discrepancies, in percentage terms, depend on product characteristics, such as list prices. Second, I quantify the discrepancy in consumer welfare induced by the shopping platform.
